This is the INSTALL file for Xelf.

This file gives you instructions on how to download Xelf and
compile it from the source code. 

If you are on GNU/Linux, you must install certain libraries through
your distributions' software installer: namely, sdl, sdl-image,
sdl-mixer, sdl-gfx, and sdl-ttf. You may additionally need to install the
corresponding *-dev versions of those packages.

1. If you have not already done so, download Xelf:
  
   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/xelf.git 

2. Install Quicklisp
    
    http://www.quicklisp.org/ It takes only a few moments to install
    Quicklisp, and this is the best way to download and install all
    the Common Lisp libraries that Xelf depends on---automatically.

    After installing quicklisp you will see a notice about adding
    Quicklisp to your Lisp startup file with (ql:add-to-init-file).

    Doing this will make Quicklisp load automatically when you start
    your Lisp implementation, but it isn't strictly required.
   
3. At the shell, 

     cd ~/src/xelf    # or wherever you installed it...
     sbcl       

   Once SBCL is started, enter and execute the following Lisp
   expressions one at a time:

      ;; load dependencies via Quicklisp
      (ql:quickload 
    	 '(:lispbuilder-sdl-mixer :lispbuilder-sdl-ttf 
	 :lispbuilder-sdl-image :uuid :cl-opengl :cl-fad))

      ;; compile and load Xelf
      (push #P"~/src/xelf/" asdf:*central-registry*)
      (asdf:load-system :xelf)

4.  My game "cypress" is written with Xelf, and can be downloaded via git:

      	  git clone git@github.com:dto/cypress.git

      Then in SBCL:
      
      (push #P"~/src/cypress/" asdf:*central-registry*) 
      (asdf:load-system :cypress)
      (setf xelf:*user-projects-directory* #P"~/src/")
      (cypress:cypress)

5. Getting help and reporting bugs 

   When reporting bugs, please use the issue reporting system at
   Github if possible: https://github.com/dto/xelf/issues

   If not possible or if other questions arise, you can email or IRC
   me as follows:

   dto@blocky.io
